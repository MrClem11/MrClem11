<h1>Hi, I'm Sean! </h1>
  <b>I'm transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on becoming a SOC analyst. As a student in the UC Berkeley Extension Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I've gained hands-on experience in security monitoring and digital forensics. My GitHub showcases the projects that have prepared me for the challenges of a SOC analyst role. I'm excited to connect with others in the field and contribute to the cybersecurity community.</b>
  <b>Outside of cybersecurity, I love playing music and enjoy exploring interesting whiskey with friends. I'm excited to connect with others in the field and contribute to the cybersecurity community.</b>
