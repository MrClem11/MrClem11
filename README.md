<h1>Hi, I'm Sean! </h1>
  <b>I'm transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on becoming a SOC analyst. As a student in the UC Berkeley Extension Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I've gained hands-on experience in security monitoring and digital forensics. My GitHub showcases the projects that have prepared me for the challenges of a SOC analyst role. I'm excited to connect with others in the field and contribute to the cybersecurity community.</b>

<h3>Project: Penetration Test Simulation</h3>
 
- <b>Overview: Pentest overview
Tools: Google Dorking, Shodan.io, cve.org, Recon ng, Zenmap, Searchsploit, Python, Nmap, Metasploit, John the Ripper, Mitre Att&ck.
This penetration test simulated a real-world cyberattack, following standard methodologies to assess the security posture of MegacorpOne. Below is an overview of the phases, key activities, and tools used:

Planning & Reconnaissance
In this phase, we outlined the scope, goals, and parameters of the test. Using tools such as Google Dorking, Shodan.io, Recon-ng, and cve.org, we gathered publicly accessible information about MegacorpOne, identifying assets and potential entry points.

Scanning
We performed network scans using Zenmap and Nmap to identify open ports and services. Additionally, we utilized Responder to capture incoming LLMNR broadcasts, which could reveal sensitive information about the network.

Exploitation
Using Searchsploit, Metasploit, and Python, we launched targeted attacks against the discovered vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system. SSH was used to securely connect to compromised systems and maintain control over the environment.

Post-Exploitation
Once access was achieved, we used tools like John the Ripper to crack passwords and retrieve valuable data from the compromised environment. This step illustrated the potential damage that could occur if the system were successfully breached.

Reporting & Mitigations
Throughout the test, we followed the MITRE ATT&CK framework to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential attack vectors. The final report documented all steps, findings, and recommended mitigations to address the discovered vulnerabilities.
