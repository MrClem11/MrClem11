<h1>Hi, I'm Sean! </h1>
  <b>I'm transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on becoming a SOC analyst. As a student in the UC Berkeley Extension Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I've gained hands-on experience in security monitoring and digital forensics. My GitHub showcases the projects that have prepared me for the challenges of a SOC analyst role. I'm excited to connect with others in the field and contribute to the cybersecurity community.</b>
  <b>Outside of cybersecurity, I love playing music and enjoy exploring interesting whiskey with friends. I'm excited to connect with others in the field and contribute to the cybersecurity community.</b>

<h3>Project: Penetration CTF Test Simulation</h3>
 
- <b>Overview: Pentest overview
I performed a comprehensive security analysis on web applications and operating systems using a variety of tools. For web applications, I identified XSS vulnerabilities, SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), PHP Injection, and Command Injection using tools like Burp Suite and SQLMap, highlighting risks ranging from minimal to critical. I also detected issues in session management and directory traversal, which posed threats to user authentication and data security.

On Linux, I conducted OSINT and network scanning using Nmap and Nessus, discovering vulnerabilities related to SSL certificates, privilege escalation, and remote code execution in applications like Tomcat and Drupal. Post-exploitation control revealed moderate ongoing risks.

For Windows, I used Nmap, Metasploit, and OSINT techniques to expose vulnerabilities in SLMail, HTTP/FTP enumeration, and user enumeration. I also identified critical flaws in access escalation and scheduled tasks that could lead to unauthorized system control.

This assessment showcased my ability to uncover critical security flaws and implement various tools effectively in both offensive and defensive security contexts.</b>
